## Subscription to a service

Content providers needs posibillity to make recurring payments (subscription payments) without user interaction. Instead of sending Lightning invoice to user a service can use pregenerated subscription key (lnurls). There is also specified a "subscription" QR code which contains a specialized `LNURL` which wallet can use to prefill subscription form and send generated LNURL (lnurls) to callback server.

According to LUD-17, there will be used prefix `lnurls://` for LNURL-subscription, i.e. `subscription`;

### Wallet to service interaction flow:

1. `LN SERVICE` generate LNURL QR code
2. User scans a LNURL QR code or accesses an `lightning:LNURL..` link with `LN WALLET` and `LN WALLET` decodes LNURL.
3. `LN WALLET` makes a GET request to `LN SERVICE` using the decoded LNURL.
4. `LN WALLET` gets JSON response from `LN SERVICE` of form:
    ```Typescript
    {
        "tag": "subscription", // type of LNURL
        "model": "recurring" or "pay-per-view", // type subscription
        "callback": string, // The URL which `LN SERVICE` would accept a subscription key (lnurls)
        "subscription_id": string, // `LN SERVICE` unique ID of subscription 
        "limit": {
            "amount": number, // limit amount in millisatoshis
            "period": string, // limit period is enum: DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, YEARLY
            "currency": string, // limit currency is ISO 4217 three characters currency code
            "periodStart": number, // limit periodStart is unix timestamp. In case of recurring model `LN WALLET` will call LNURLS after this time plus N*period
        }
        "metadata": string, // Metadata json which must be presented as raw string
    }
    ```
    or

    ```JSON
    {"status": "ERROR", "reason": "error details..."}
    ```
    
    `metadata` json array must contain one `text/plain` entry, all other types of entries are optional.
    `metadata` json array must contain either one `image/png;base64` entry or one `image/jpeg;base64` entry or neither.

    The `metadata` json array is only allowed to contain arrays. The first item of an array inside the `metadata` array is always a string representing the metadata type while any item that follows can be of any JSON type. Implementors MUST NOT assume it will always be a string.

    ```Typescript
    [
        [
            "text/plain", // mandatory,
            string // short description displayed when paying and in transaction log
        ],
        [
            "text/long-desc", // optional
            string // longer description of the payment, MAY contain newlines
        ],
        [
            "image/png;base64", // optional
            string // base64 string, 512x512px PNG thumbnail which will represent this lnurl in a list or grid. Up to 136536 characters (100Kb of image data in base-64 encoding)
        ],
        [
            "image/jpeg;base64", // optional
            string // base64 string, 512x512px JPG thumbnail which will represent this lnurl in a list or grid. Up to 136536 characters (100Kb of image data in base-64 encoding)
        ],
        // future entries:
        [
            string,
            any
        ]
    ]
    ```

    and be sent as a string:

    ```JSON
    "[[\"text/plain\", \"lorem ipsum blah blah\"]]"
    ```
    
5. `LN WALLET` Displays a subscription create dialog and show limit values.
6. Once accepted by the user, `LN WALLET` create subscription LNURL and subscription key and sends a POST to `LN SERVICE` in the form of
    ```Typescript
    {
        "action": string, // type of request, in this case "create" for create of subscription
        "subscription_id": string, // `LN SERVICE` unique ID of subscription
        "subscription_key": string, // key generated by `LN WALLET`
        "subscription_url": string, // LNURL of `LN WALLET`, which is used for accepting invoices or changing subscription details
        "paylink": string, // optional, is raw URL (not bech32-encoded) as described in LUD-17 and is used for getting LN invoice to refund money
    }
    ```
7. `LN SERVICE` sends a `{"status": "OK"}` or `{"status": "ERROR", "reason": "error details..."}` JSON response.

## Payment of the invoice
1. `LN SERVICE` sends a POST to "subscription_url" in form of
    ```Typescript
    {
        "subscription_id": string, // `LN SERVICE` unique ID of subscription
        "subscription_key": string, // key generated by `LN WALLET`
        "lightning_invoice" nebo "pr"?: string, // invoice to be payed by `LN WALLET`
    }
    ```
2. `LN WALLET` checks "subscription_key" and invoice, whether its amount does not exceed the allowed limit. The amount is calculated in the currency that was defined for the limit. The period for the check is counted from the moment periodStart + n * period, where n is the highest possible for the given moment to be in the past. If the date does not exist, then the last date in the given month is used.
3. If the check is successful `LN WALLET` pays the invoice

## Subscription cancellation
1. `LN WALLET` sends a POST to "subscription_url" in form of
    ```Typescript
    {
        "action": string, // type of request, in this case "cancel"
        "subscription_id": string, // `LN SERVICE` unique ID of subscription
        "subscription_key": string, // key generated by `LN WALLET`
    }
    ```
2. `LN WALLET` internally mark subscription as canceled and no payment will be allowed
3. `LN SERVICE` internally mark subscription as canceled and no payment will be charged


## Subscription updating
1. `LN WALLET` sends a POST to "subscription_url" in form of
    ```Typescript
    {
        "action": string, // type of request, in this case "update"
        "subscription_id": string, // `LN SERVICE` unique ID of subscription
        "subscription_key": string, // key generated by `LN WALLET`
        "limit": {
            "amount": number, // limit amount in millisatoshis

            "currency": string, // limit currency is ISO 4217 three characters currency code
            "periodStart": number, // limit periodStart is unix timestamp. In case of recurring model `LN WALLET` will call LNURLS after this time plus N*period
        }
    }
    
    ```
2. `LN WALLET` internally updates subcription limits
3. `LN SERVICE` internally updates subcription limits
